            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p class="bg-white py-3 px-3 border-gray my-3">Our name was chosen to convey the restaurant’s welcoming
                environment,
                as it truly
                is
                «the
                address» for
                friends, colleagues and tourists to meet up at any time of day. At BlaBla we serve innovative breakfast,
                brunch, lunch and dinner
                menus, as well as pâtisserie created on site in the classic French tradition. Our diverse beverage
                program
                includes artisanal cocktails, fruit and vegetable blends, spritzers and one-of- a-kind coffee drinks
                prepared by an award-winning barista team.</p>
